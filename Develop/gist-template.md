# # Understanding Email Validation Using Regex(Regular Expressions)

This tutorial was created to explain how regular expressions (regex) can be used to validate email addresses. Regular expressions provide a powerful way to match patterns in strings, and in this case, ensure that email addresses are in a valid format.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will break down the following regex, which is used to validate email addresses:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

## Regex Components

### Anchors
- `^`: This anchor asserts the start of a line.
- `$`: This anchor asserts the end of a line.
### Quantifiers
- `([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`: This part captures the user name in an email address.
- `[a-z0-9_\.-]`: This character set includes lowercase alphabetic characters, digits, underscores, dots, and hyphens.
- `+`: This indicates that the preceding character set ([a-z0-9_\.-]) must appear at least once but can be repeated multiple times. This means the user name part of the email can contain any combination and number of these characters, as long as it has at least one.
